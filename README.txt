The next modding framework for Minecraft Bedrock Server on Windows
examples: https://github.com/Sysca11/BedrockKit
LICENCE:
GPLv3 with extra restrictions&exceptions
restrictions:
! First of all,you must accept the Minecraft EULA.
! It means DO NOT MAKE COMMERICIAL USE OF ANYTHING which breaks the EULA.
! Accepting this LICENSE means you ACCEPTED Minecraft EULA(https://account.mojang.com/terms) too.
! If you violate the EULA,any legal liability is IRRELEVANT to the developer
! NO WARRANTY 

Second,If you provides a server hosting service,you can use this framework for free,but you SHOULD NOT make PRIVATE changes to this framework as a selling point.If you fixed or tweaked the code,please pull request,instead of making it private for commercial use.

Do not do evil.

exceptions:
Although we expected to build an open-source community,but forcing everything open-source will ruin this community.
So you can write mods based on BDX with ANY open-source license or even dont publish your source code.
but if you modified the framework,or write a new framework based on this framework,you NEED to open-source it.
